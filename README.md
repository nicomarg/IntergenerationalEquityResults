The makefile is setup to compile the listed .tex files from the src/ folder to a pdf/ folder (using latexmk).
To add a new file, add its name (without extension) to the list FILES at the first line of the Makefile.

The package `QED.sty` py Paul Taylor is needed to compile the file `caracterisation.tex`. It can be found on [this webpage](https://www.paultaylor.eu/proofs/QEDdoc)
